Stranger Visions
Heather Dewey-Haborg

I was drawn to Stranger Visions, created by Heather Dewey-Haborg, because the project essentially stemmed from the artist’s keen observational skills and desire to see what she could do with a small observation that she made. In a public statement, Dewey-Haborg explained that her inspiration for Stranger Visions came when she noticed a single hair that was stuck in a crack of a print on the wall of her therapist’s office. She found herself fascinated to learn more about the story behind this hair and realized that if she could extract DNA from it, she could find out a lot more about the person who left it. This small observation grew into a much larger project in which Dewey-Haborg extracts DNA from artifacts such as litter on the streets and then uses a custom computer program to create a 3D print of the face. I find Stranger Visions interesting because of the ethical questions that it brings about. Is it ethical to create 3D prints of strangers who just happened to leave a piece of hair or a cigarette butt behind? It is clear from the news media that the conversation about the implications of technological innovations on privacy concerns is just getting started. This piece encouraged me to think about where I stand in this debate, even though I still lack a clear position. Stranger Visions has been displayed in a variety of locations between 2012 and 2014 including Fotomuseum, Winterthur, Article Biennial, Norway, Saint Gaudens national historic site, The New York Public Library, Ars Electronica, Eyebeam, Science Gallery Dublin, the 92Y Tribeca, Clocktower Gallery, Washington Project for the Arts, and University of Technology Gallery in Sydney. I also find it fascinating how, despite criticism and ethical concerns, this project has reached such a wide audience.

Inside The Flower Matrix
Claudia Hart

I was drawn to Inside The Flower Matrix, created by Claudia Hart, due to the unique way in which users have the ability to interact with the art. Inside The Flower Matrix has been displayed in a variety of locations including the James Thompson Art Gallery in San Jose, CA from March 7th to April 16th, 2017 and the TRANSFER Gallery from November 30th to January 28th, 2018. When this project is on display, users have the ability to scan Hart’s artwork like a QR code in order to gain access into the virtual world that she has created. This project dissolves the line between the “real world” and the “virtual world.” I love the way Hart uses her piece to highlight the many complex layers of technology, using familiar images such as emojis and QR codes but blending them together in a beautiful way. Inside The Flower Matrix also highlights Hart’s meticulous attention to detail - it even includes wallpaper and ceramic tiles in the virtual world that Hart herself has created. Hart’s work is a perfect representation of technology to me - layers upon layers of information that can seem never ending.
